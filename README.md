# COVID-19 Data Analysis 🚀

## 🌐 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 cases and deaths in California counties using publicly available datasets. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, normalization per population, and anomaly correction for accurate insights.

## 📊 Data Sources

* COVID-19 Cases and Deaths: [Johns Hopkins University CSSE COVID-19 Dataset](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
* Population Data: [California Population Data](https://gist.github.com/Nillsf/7923a8c7f27ca98ec75b7e1529f259bb)

## ⚡️ Features

* ✅ Clean and well-structured code
* ✅ Data normalization per million for accurate comparisons
* ✅ Automatic anomaly detection and correction
* ✅ Interactive visualizations of COVID-19 trends

## 🚀 Analysis Steps

1. 📥 Data Loading and Initial Exploration
2. 🧹 Data Cleaning and Transformation
3. 📊 Normalization Per Million (Population)
4. 🚨 Anomaly Detection and Correction
5. 📈 Visualization of COVID-19 Trends

## 🚀 Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZeyadMostafa22/covid-19-data-analysis.git
```

2. Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or any Python environment.

## 📌 Customization

* Modify the list of `selected_counties` for customized analysis.
* Adjust the anomaly detection method in the `fix_anomalies` function.
* Explore other states by changing the `state` parameter in the `clean_data` function.
